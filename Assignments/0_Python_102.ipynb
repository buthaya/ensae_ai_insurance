    "#### Objects in Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **object-oriented programming language**. This means that instead of writing code with a focus on what the computer needs to do, we focus our attention on what data we are working with and how it should interact. An object is an important concept in programming. They allow modular implementation and make maintenance and development easier than without.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an object? As the name implies, the initial idea of object programming is to represent physical objects. Every physical object can be described by its properties (attributes) and can interact with the outside (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a programming object can be pictured as an atomic unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Its name (type).\n",
    "* Its attributes (properties).\n",
    "* Its methods (functions you can apply to it).\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we manipulated objects without really being aware of it. For instance, when we defined a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mylist = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `mylist` is the name of the object.\n",
    "* Attributes are the values of items inside the list.\n",
    "* Methods are all the functions you can call on a list. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mylist.append(4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then be able to define our own objects with Python. Many libraries are object-oriented. Thus, controlling objects in Python is quite important. Let's look at the following example. Imagine we want to implement an Employee as an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Employee can be described by his/her name and different properties. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Name\n",
    "* Age\n",
    "* Time he/she has spent in the company\n",
    "* Helpfulness (notation between 1 and 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "An Employee also has some skills like being able to compute the cross-product or add two numbers. Imagine also they have a special skill to return the square of the sum of their Age and the time they have spent in the company. The methods can be then listed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* cross_product\n",
    "* addition\n",
    "* special_skill\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the syntax to define an object is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class object_name():\n",
    "    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2): # constructor: present in every object\n",
    "        self.v1 = attribute1\n",
    "        self.v2 = attribute2\n",
    "\n",
    "    def methods1(self, x1, x2):\n",
    "        result = self.v1 + x1 * x2\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once defined, below is an example of how to declare a new object and use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# construction\n",
    "myobj = object_name(attribute1, attribute2) # attributes required in the __init__ function. Note that self is not required since it is the object itself\n",
    "\n",
    "# call a method\n",
    "myobj.methods1(x1, x2) # call of methods1 associated with the object\n",
    "\n",
