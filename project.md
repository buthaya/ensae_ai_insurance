# Exam modalities

Project topic: Application of AI in insurance

Evaluation format: 25 minutes presentation: 15 minutes + 10 minutes question

Support : Slides (maximum 10 slides)

Requirements:

- You will have to choose at least one machine learning algorithm and one deep learning model
- Throughout the process, maintain documentation and version control to keep track of changes and ensure reproducibility: usage of github repo.

### Problem Definition:
Define the specific business problem you are trying to solve with machine learning. This could be anything from customer churn prediction to sentiment analysis or fraud detection. Ensure clarity on the problem statement and the desired outcome. You can look for existing research papers, open-source projects, tutorials, and applications related to your problem domain. This will provide insights into the methodologies and techniques that have been successful for similar problems. Make sure your solution is realistic, and data is easily available.

### Data Collection:
Identify relevant data sources and collect the necessary data. Ensure that the data is diverse, representative, and free from biases or sensitive information. This may involve web scraping, accessing public datasets, or collecting data from APIs.

### Data Cleaning and Labeling:
Clean the collected data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers. Label the data appropriately for supervised learning tasks. Pay attention to data quality to ensure reliable model performance.

### Data Preparation:
Prepare the cleaned data for analysis by performing feature engineering, scaling, and augmentation. Use visualization tools to explore the data distribution and identify patterns that can improve model performance.

### Model Selection and Training:
Choose suitable machine learning algorithms or neural network architectures based on the problem requirements and data characteristics. Train the model using cross-validation techniques and optimize hyperparameters to achieve the best performance. For the project, **you will have to choose at least one machine learning algorithm and one deep learning model.**

### Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as F1 score, AUC score, or RMSE, depending on the problem type. Visualize feature importance to identify relevant features and improve model interpretability. Assess model training and inference times to ensure scalability.

### Iterative Improvement:
Iteratively refine the model by experimenting with different feature engineering techniques, model architectures, and machine learning frameworks. Continuously collect feedback and iterate on the process to improve model performance.

### Bonus - Prototype Development:
Develop a prototype implementation of the machine learning solution with framework like [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) or [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/). It allows for rapid validation of ideas, identification of potential issues early on, and gathering of feedback for iterative improvement from domain experts and stakeholders.
